# Innomatics Hackathon - Internship Project
This repository contains the code for the hackathon project developed as part of the Innomatics Internship program.

# Problem Statement
The problem statement for the hackathon was to create a solution for the dataset by Building a Machine Learning Model to predict output based on the input column.
Use appropriate evaluation metrics and compare all the models and write your observations i.e. why is one model better than the other?

# Solution
Building a machine learning model to predict an output based on a single input column can be a simple task if you have the right tools and approach. Here are the steps you can follow to build such a model:

1)Collect and Prepare Data: Start by collecting data that is relevant to your problem. Make sure the data is clean, consistent and free of any errors.

2)Choose a Model: Select an appropriate machine learning model based on the type of problem you are trying to solve and the nature of the data. For example, if you are dealing with a regression problem (predicting a continuous value), you can use linear regression. If you are dealing with a classification problem (predicting a categorical value), you can use logistic regression.

3)Train the Model: Train the model using the data you collected. You can split the data into a training set and a test set. Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the test set.

4)Fine-tune the Model: Based on the performance of the model on the test set, you may need to fine-tune the model by changing the parameters, or by using a different model.

5)Make Predictions: Once you are satisfied with the performance of the model, you can use it to make predictions on new, unseen data.
